## Getting Started

MySQL

1. Copy files to localhost
2. Create a table in DB called *calendar*, and create the tables found in *calendar.sql*
3. Open *auth.php* and enter your DB credentials
4. Open *index.php* from browser

JSON

1. Copy files to localhost
2. Open *index-json.php* from browser

**Note:** If event editing not "sticking" on refresh, verify file permissions are sufficient. ``` ls -l ```

# Event Structure

```
[{"id":4,
  "rid":4,
